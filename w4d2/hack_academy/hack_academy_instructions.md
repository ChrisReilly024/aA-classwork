CSS Workflow Exercise
Have some fun practicing with the Chrome Developer Tools!

Head over to App Academy
Open up the Chrome Developer Tools, Elements and Styles Panes
Delete some HTML elements
Move around some HTML elements
Copy and paste some HTML elements
Edit some elements as HTML and change some text
Turn off some styles
Copy and paste some styles
Try to change some style property values
Take a screenshot of your most creative rendition of the App Academy homepage and send it to instructors-sf@appacademy.io for sf students, or instructors-ny@appacademy.io for ny students.
This exercise should stress the power of the developer tools and demonstrate how we can manipulate pages within the browser to make front-end development more efficient. Have fun exploring different CSS properties before we begin formally learning CSS syntax.
